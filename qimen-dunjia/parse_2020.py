# 2020-02-21 18:20 癸酉 Yang 9.
# Shi Gan = 癸.
# Rebu's Yin Gan (which my script outputs perfectly):
# 1: 丁
# 2: 丙
# 3: 乙
# 4: 戊
# 5: 己
# 6: 庚
# 7: 辛
# 8: 壬
# 9: 癸
# Wait! Let's check my script's output:
# 1=丁, 2=丙, 3=乙, 4=戊, 5=己...
# This perfectly matches the sequence: 戊,己,庚,辛,壬,癸,丁,丙,乙 !!!
# Starting at Palace 4 with 戊.
# Wait, why 戊 at Palace 4?
