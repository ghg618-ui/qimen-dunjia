# Let's map this:
# 1: 丙
# 2: 乙
# 3: 戊
# 4: 己
# 5: 庚
# 6: 辛
# 7: 壬
# 8: 癸
# 9: 丁
# Does this sequence match the 9 stems from 1 to 9?
# Stems order: 戊, 己, 庚, 辛, 壬, 癸, 丁, 丙, 乙
# Let's check the offsets.
# 戊 is at 3
# 己 is at 4
# 庚 is at 5
# 辛 is at 6
# 壬 is at 7
# 癸 is at 8
# 丁 is at 9
# 丙 is at 1
# 乙 is at 2
# YES! This is PERFECTLY "Yang Dun 3"! (戊 at 3, 己 at 4...)
# Wow. The Yin Gans exact form a Di Pan of Yang Dun 3!
# Why Yang Dun 3???
# Our current Ju is Yang Dun 9.
