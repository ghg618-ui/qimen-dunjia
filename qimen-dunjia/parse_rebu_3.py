# So the Yin Gan layout is EXACTLY identical to the Di Pan (Earth Pan) layout for a specific Ju!
# In 2026-02-22 09:46 乙巳, Yang Dun 9.
# Hour: 乙 (index 8).
# Zhi Shi: Du Men (from Palace 4).
# We calculated Zhi Shi falls into Center 5.
# If Zhi Shi falls into 5, we put 乙 into 5! 
# But wait, Rebu has 庚 in 5!
# Why does Rebu have 庚 in 5?
# Let's see: 戊 in 3, 己 in 4, 庚 in 5!
# So Rebu's starting stem is 戊 at 3.
# Where did 戊 come from??
# Is it the Xun Shou (甲辰壬)? No, Xun Shou is 壬.
# Is it the Di Pan of the hour branch? Hour is 巳.
# Is it the Di Pan of the day stem? Day is 丁.
